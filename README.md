## Description

The Horiseon starter code was refactored in order to improve accessibility. 

Semantic elements were added to improve accessibility for inclusive tools like braille readers and speak functions. Search optimisation is also improved by semantic elements because the browser is able to locate data effectively and efficiently. Descriptive alt text was provided for images and figures to allow users information about these elements if they are inaccessible.

There were challenges involving pathways during deployment, so testing and trialling was an important step.
